### OBJECTIVE
Have you wished your Java program would run faster? Maybe you were seeking a JVM based scripting language to perform as great as Java? Wouldn't it be cool if you could transpile your polyglot language to perform at native speeds? Then you might have just found the holy grail. Wait the spelling is misleading, but the results are not, introducing GraalVM. This is a universal virtual machine that can take any JVM language and convert it to a faster byte code embedded in the JVM, or compile byte code via LLVM to a native application. Examples will include Java, JavaScript, and Kotlin. The attendee will leave this session understanding how to get started optimizing their applications via GraalVM to gain native speeds.
